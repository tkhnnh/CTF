[CVE-2025-68613](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68613)

Platform : `n8n`
Date Found :  December 19, 2025
CVSS Score : 9.9
Source : [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/n8ncve202568613)
## Overview
n8n is an open-source workflow automation platform designed to visually connect applications and services for task automation

The n8n platform is commonly deployed in three primary configurations:

- Self-hosted instances: Organizations deploy n8n on-premises or in private cloud environments for full control and data sovereignty
- Cloud-hosted (n8n.cloud): Managed service offering with shared infrastructure
- Internal automation tools: Deployed within corporate networks to automate business processes between internal and external systems

-> n8n processes user input wrapped in double curly braces {{ }} as JavaScript code without adequate sandboxing or input validation.
-> The expression evaluator lacks proper context isolation, allowing attackers to escape the intended evaluation sandbox.
-> Authentication provides no meaningful protection against this vulnerability, as any authenticated user can exploit it.

Working payload
`{{ (function(){ return this.process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('id').toString() })() }}`

`this` refers to the global object in the Node.js execution context
`process` is a Node.js global object providing access to system processes
`mainModule` references the root module of the Node.js application

=>  aims to bypass typical JavaScript sandbox restrictions by accessing Node.js internals (the root module)

Now that the mainModule object is reached, we see .require('child_process'). 
This uses require(), i.e., Node.js’s module loading function, in order to load child_process, a core Node.js module for executing system commands. 
It should be noted that user expressions should never have access to Node.js’s module system, especially dangerous modules like child_process.
