# Principles of Malware Analysis
Malware analysis is the process of examining a malicious file to understand its functionality, operation and methods for defence against it.
2 branches of malware analysis `static` and `dynamic`

## Sandboxes
golden rule in malware analysis : never run dangerous application on devices you care about

potentially malicious code and applications should only be run in a safe, isolated environment

# Static Analysis
Quick and effective way to understand how sample may operate

Some of information that can be gathered from static analysis:
- Checksums
- Strings (ip,urls,commands,passwords)
- Imports
- Resources (icon)

Executive Summary:
Launch PeStudio
Load the executable into PeStudio
Click on the "indicators" tab in the dropdown

# Dynamic Analysis
## Regshot
widely used utility -> creating two "snapshots" of the registry - one b4 and one after malware run

First, change the output directory capture to the user's desktop using the box with three dots in the "Output path" section
Press 1st shot and then Shot on the dropdown
