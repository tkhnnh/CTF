# Alert Triaging
When multiple alert appear, analysts should have a consistent method to assess and prioritise them quickly. There are 4 factors:
- Severity Level : How bad? 
- Timestamp and Frequency : When? 
- Attack Stage : Where in the attack lifecycle ?
- Affected Asset : who or what is affected
After reviewing these factors -> escalte to the IR team, perform deeper investigation or close the alert

# Diving Deeper into an alert
- Investigate the alert in detail
- Check the related logs
- Correlate multiple alerts
- Build context and a timeline
- Decide on the following icon
-> Sign of compromise -> escalate to the IR team
-> Investigate more if more evidence or colleration needed
-> Close or suppress if the alert is confirmed false positive, and update detection rules accordingly
- Document findings and lessons learned
