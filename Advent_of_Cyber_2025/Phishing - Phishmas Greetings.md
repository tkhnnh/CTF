# Intentions behind phishing

- Credential theft: Tricking users into revealing passwords or login details.
- Malware delivery: Disguising malicious attachments or links as safe content.
- Data exfiltration: Gathering sensitive company or personal information.
- Financial fraud: Persuading victims to transfer money or approve fake invoices.

# Why spam is not phishing

- Promotion: Advertising products, services, or events. Often unsolicited or low-quality.
- Scams: Spreading fake offers or “get rich quick” schemes to attract clicks.
- Traffic generation (clickbait): Driving users to external sites or boosting ad metrics.
- Data harvesting: Collecting active email addresses for future campaigns.

# Social engineering

- Impersonation: Is a type of Social Engineering. The attacker is pretending to be McSkidy!
- Sense of urgency: We can observe words such as "urgent" and "immediately" to pressure the recipient.
- Side channel: The attacker tries to discourage the recipients from reaching McSkidy using his standard communication channels (phone and email address).
- Malicious intention: The attacker is trying to trick the user into giving VPN credentials. They can also try to ask for approval of payments, opening malware, or sharing sensitive data.
