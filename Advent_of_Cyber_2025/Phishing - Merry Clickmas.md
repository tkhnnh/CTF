Social Engineering -> manipulating a user to make a mistake
Phishing -> subset of social engineering
Questions before acting on an email:
- Suspicious?
- Telling me to click something?
- Offering me an amazing deal?
- Pushing me to do something now?

  Second S.T.O.P reminds:
- Slow down. Scammers run on your adrenaline.
- Type the address yourself. Don’t use the message’s link.
- Open nothing unexpected. Verify first.
- Prove the sender. Check the real From address/number, not just the display name.
